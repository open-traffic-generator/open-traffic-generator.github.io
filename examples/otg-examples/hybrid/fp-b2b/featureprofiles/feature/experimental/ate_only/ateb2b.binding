# proto-message: openconfig.testing.Binding

# This is an example static binding that demonstrates how to specify
# options to be used in conjunction with the atedut_*.testbed
# testbeds.

# These options are inherited throughout the entire binding for both the
# DUT and the ATE, unless overridden by a specific device or protocol.
options {
  username: "admin"
  password: "Ixia!123_richardson"
}

ates {
  id: "ate"
  name: "10.24.50.12"  # Change this to the Ixia chassis name.

  # Options specific to the IxNetwork API.  Remove if not needed.
  ixnetwork {
    # Change this to the Web UI hostname, if it differs from the Ixia
    # chassis name.
    target: "10.24.50.12"
    skip_verify: true
  }

  # Before this binding can be used with a topology, add ports mapping
  # from its topology ID to the actual port name on the device.
  ports {
    id: "port1"
    name: "1/3"  # Change this to the actual port name.
  }
  ports {
    id: "port2"
    name: "1/4"  # Change this to the actual port name.
  }
}
